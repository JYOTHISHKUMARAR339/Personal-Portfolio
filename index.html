    <h1>Self Introduction</h1>

    <p class="intro-box">
        <strong>Hello everyone,</strong><br><br>

        My name is <strong>Jyothishkumar A R</strong>. I am a
        <strong>Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student</strong>
        with a strong interest in software development and problem-solving.
        <br><br>

        I have basic to intermediate knowledge of programming languages such as
        <strong>Java, Python, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and MySQL</strong>.
        I am particularly interested in understanding how systems work,
        especially in the areas of web development, databases, computer networks,
        operating systems, and software engineering.
        <br><br>

        I have worked on academic concepts and mini-projects including
        smart billing systems, attendance systems using face recognition,
        IoT-based structural monitoring systems, and basic web applications.
        These experiences have helped me understand how theoretical knowledge
        can be applied to real-world problems.
        <br><br>

        I regularly explore new technologies, tools, and frameworks, and I
        continuously improve my technical skills through coding practice and
        strengthening my core computer science fundamentals.
